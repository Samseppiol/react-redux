## Section 2 Notes:

### Downwards data flow
> The most parent component in the application should be responsible for fetching data. In our instance, index.js

### Syntactic Sugar
> When the key and the variable name are the same when setting the state, because of ES6 you only have to type one of them.
> E.g this.setState({videos: videos})<br> can be changed to this.setState({videos})
